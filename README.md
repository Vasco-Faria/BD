## Introduction

Our final project is a modeling of a database of the Youtube platform that allows users to publish and view the published content. 

The content can be videos, lives and reals.

 Can also do various things such as subscribing to other users, liking content, comment on the content, make playlists and even subscribe to the premium.

 ## Requeriments

- The user has to create an account, registering with an e-mail, an access password, user name, first name, date of birth. The user can still subscribe to the premium which has a monthly fee and closing data. You can also like each video you see.
- The user has a history with the viewing date of the videos he saw and also the name of the videos and the channel to which the video belongs.
- Each channel belongs to a user has the number of followers, the number of available content, and even has a description and can subscribe to other channels.
- The available content belongs to a channel and can be watched by a user, each content has a duration, the number of likes, a description, comments and a title. The description has a number of views, a publication date and text. The comment belongs to a channel and has the corresponding text. Content can still belong to a playlist that has a name, number of likes, belongs to a channel, and can be private or not. In addition, the content has ads that have a duration belonging to the company's channel and number of ads.
- The available content has 3 states: public, private and unlisted and can still be of 3 types: video, live, reels.
- Each content has ads, but if the user is premium, they no longer have them.
